# BlockHard

BlockHard is an adult-themed mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 and above made using the Fabric. It’s a full remake and modern reimagining of the old 1.12.2 Sex mod (now known as Fapcraft) original made by Schnurri_tv, rebuilt from scratch to work with fabric and current versions of Minecraft.

## Current Features

### Entities
As of right now there is only one girl that has implemented which is Lucy, My OC. She is Tameable with the Allium Flower and only reacts to her owner/partner.
If you right-click you can open up a GUI that includes her inventory and buttons for interactions like making her sit down or start a sex scene. You can set her base coordinates through the Inventory GUI. This is used when her health gets below zero as she respawns at the base instead of dying. You can also shift right-click to make her sit and stand without opening the GUI

### Animation and Physics
- Implements custom jiggle physics on bones (like breasts) using a spring-damper system.
- Jiggle behavior is affected by movement, inertia, and rotation changes.
